    HEY TEA originated from an instant inspiration of mixing cheese with tea. With this flash of inspiration, we started from a small tea
shop of less than 20m in a lane called Jiangbianli in Jiangmen City, and arrived at where we are today. Your spark of inspiration, too,
can put a dent in the universe.
</p>
<p class="nowap">
With stores in China and Singapore, we currently operate our business under the brand name 'HEYTEA' or 'HEYTEA BAKERY'. We do
not operate any franchise stores, please be advised.
