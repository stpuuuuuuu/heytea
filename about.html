	<h1>BRAND INTRODUCTION</h1>
<div class="about aboutbox">
<p>
HEYTEA originated from an instant inspiration of mixing cheese with tea. In 2012, with this
spark of inspiration, we opened a small tea shop on a lane called Jiangbianli in Jiangmen City
of Guangdong Province. We've come a long way, starting from a 20 m<sup>2</sup> store to our outlets
across Asia today.
</p>
<p>

As the creator of the original Cheezo Tea, HEYTEA sources the finest tea globally, hoping to
breathe new life into the traditional tea culture. In 2016, we obtained over RMB 100 million
from IDG Capital and angel investor He Boquan.

	<h1>AESTHETICS</h1>
<div class="about aboutbox">
<p>
In addition to providing quality tea to tea drinkers,<br>
Heytea is dedicated to exploring more possibilities for tea drinking.<br>
Adhered to the original spirit, Heytea supports artistic creation,<br>
make drinking tea become a style, a way of life.
</p>
<p>
From product research to store, Heytea pays more attention to
the overall experience of consumers. The design of every store is 
a process of interpreting inspiration.Combining traditional tea culture,
"zen", "minimalism" and "aesthetics" are integrated into the store design to create spaces
with rich texture and level, bringing customers with multi-dimensional sensory experience.
The modification of the tea aesthetics makes tea culture cooler and more characteristic.
</p>
<p>In addition, Heytea cooperated with a number of independent ilustrators
to express the interest of drinking tea, and created a series of original
illustrations that conform to its brand concept. The package of
the whole product also follows the "cool" and "simple" style.

can put a dent in the universe.
